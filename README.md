Hydrobolic
==========

Aqua-inspired UI components for AppKit. Written in Swift.

This project wouldn’t be possible without the inspirations from [Kyle Halevi](https://mastodon.design/@kylehalevi/109436255622536340)’s Sketch recreation and [Jon Sterling](https://github.com/jonsterling/AquaUI)’s SwiftUI implementation.

Goals
-----

- [x] Utilize subclassing as much as possible for greater accessibility

- [ ] Support dark appearance & tint colors (graphite included) transparently
- [ ] Forward-compatible with Liquid Glass but nicer
